<h3>HTML code errors</h3>
<h4>Change 1</h4>
On line 25 I moved the b tag in front of "The", and changed the b to a p. 
This alteration fixes the difference in boldness in the beginning of the text.
<h4>Change 2</h4>
The b tag is used for emboldening text, this was not necessary here and there was a 
closing p tag at the end of the text that did not have an opening p tag.
<h4>Change 3</h4>
On line 25 I deleted extra unnessecary "<>" symbols disrupting the text.
    This removed the symbols from the text on the website.
