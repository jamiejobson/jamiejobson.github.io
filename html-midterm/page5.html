<h2>Page 2</h2>

<h3>HTML code errors</h3>
<h4>Change 1</h4>
On line 25 I moved the b tag in front of "The", and changed the b to a p. 
This alteration fixes the difference in boldness in the beginning of the text.
<h4>Change 2</h4>
The b tag is used for emboldening text, this was not necessary here and there was a 
closing p tag at the end of the text that did not have an opening p tag.
<h4>Change 3</h4>
On line 25 I deleted extra unnessecary "<>" symbols disrupting the text.
    This removed the symbols from the text on the website.
        
<h3>Structural/Logical errors</h3>
<h4>Change 4</h4>
Here I have changed the heading tags. They were previously out of sequential order.
<h4>Change 5</h4>
On line 35, I changed h3 to h2, to create a more cohesive page structure.
<h4>Change 6</h4>
On line 51, I changed h2 to h3, and deleted unnecessary bold tags.
<h4>Change 7</h4>
On line 72, I changed h6 to h3, and added a closing header tag.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Page 3</h2>
<hr>
<h3>HTML code errors</h3>
<h4>Change 1</h4>
I added a link to my page 5 changelog in the navbar.
<h4>Change 2</h4>
I found myself stuck looking for another error on this page, and eventually decided to 
make each clickable links for each component of the two lists that appear on the page.
From lines 51-55 and 62-66, I made each model/type of car into a link. 
For the first of each list, I instead made links that redirect to the correspinding wikipedia page.
        
<h3>Structural/Logical errors</h3>
<h4>Change 3</h4>
To line 3 I added the title, meta, and link to the css stylesheet (cars.css).
<hr>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<hr>
<h3>HTML code errors</h4>
<p>
<h4>Change 1</h4>
On line 36, I added a closing /td tag.
<h4>Change 2</h4>
On line 41, I added opening and closing /td tags.
<h4>Change 3</h4>
On line 46, I added an opening /td tag.

<h3>Structural/Logical errors</h3>
<h4>Change 4</h4>
Within lines 35-47, I reordered the images to fit the category of each column.
