# HTML code errors
# line 25 - Here I moved the b tag in front of "The", and changed the b to a p. 
        This alteration fixes the difference in boldness in the beginning of the text.
The b tag is used for emboldening text, this was not necessary here and there was a 
closing p tag at the end of the text that did not have an opening p tag.
# line 25 - delete extra unnessecary <> symbols disrupting the text.
        This removed the symbols from the text on the website.
