            This is my first time learning to code, 
            I am very nervous but my goal is to make it through this class 
            with a passing grade and to retain the knowledge 
            I will obtain this semester. I would also like to 
            hopefully make something I am proud of during my time here!

            I am an environmental studies major with a film studies minor and a CTD minor. 
            My hobbies include crochet, sewing, sometimes hiking, and video games. 
            I spend a lot of time watching either horror movies, anime, or real housewives.
            I also enjoy spending time with my evil cat.
